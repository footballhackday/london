        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p>We want to keep things fun and fair, so we have a few ground rules to follow.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>1. The Basics</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
Our first rule is simple: don't be a jerk. Follow this, and you'll be fine. Respect your fellow hackers, our staff, our judges and everyone else. We want Football Hack Day to be a collaborative, supportive, environment in which everyone is welcome and feels comfortable, and has a positive experience.</p>

<p>The longer version: we will provide an inclusive environment for everyone in attendance, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, citizenship or religion. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of various backgrounds.</p>

We will not tolerate harassment of any kind, including but not limited to:
<ul>
<li>offensive verbal comments</li>
<li>sexual images or clothing in public spaces (including exhibitors and expert tables)</li>
<li>deliberate intimidation</li>
<li>stalking</li>
<li>harassing photography or recording</li>
<li>inappropriate jokes</li>
<li>inappropriate Tweets or other comments on social media sites</li>
<li>sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
<li>inappropriate physical contact and unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
</ul> 
</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>If you witness a participant engaging in inappropriate behavior, are being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately.</p>

<p>Event participants violating these rules may be asked to leave the event without a refund at the sole discretion of the organizers.</p>

      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>2. Projects</h1>
      </div>
<p>The project you submit must be your own work. You need to be the creator, and you need to ensure your project doesn't infringe the rights of any third party.</p>
<p>It's fine if your project isn't 100% new, but keep in mind that projects that haven't been updated significantly during the course of the hackathon won't score very well with the judges.</p>
<p>Don't create and/or submit projects that are illegal, profane, obscene or otherwise not very nice.</p>

      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>3. Intellectual Property</h1>
      </div>
<p>You own your project. Full stop. The event organizers and sponsors have the right to mention and link to your project in order to promote the event, its results and their participation.</p>
<p>Respect others' intellectual property. Whether that is sponsor data and assets that have been made available solely for the hackathon, or it's copyrighted images and other content.</p>

      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>4. Demos and Judging</h1>
      </div>
<p>You'll be given a set amount of time in which to demo your project for the judges. This length of time will vary depending on the number of projects submitted, but will be communicated in advance. Once the clock begins, it does not stop. The clock does not pause for equipment changes or other aspects of your demo. We have to keep to the schedule in order to keep things manageable and fair for everyone.</p>
<p>Your project will be judged on the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>Originality and Creativity</li>
<li>User Experience and Design</li>
<li>Pitch Quality</li>
<li>Overall Quality</li>
