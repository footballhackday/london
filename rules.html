        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p>We want to keep things fun and fair, so we have a few ground rules to follow.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>1. The Basics</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
Our first rule is simple: don't be a jerk. Follow this, and you'll be fine. Respect your fellow hackers, our staff, our judges and everyone else. We want Football Hack Day to be a collaborative, supportive, environment in which everyone is welcome and feels comfortable, and has a positive experience.</p>

<p>The slightly longer version: Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, previous hackday attendance or computing experience (or lack of any of the aforementioned). We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any hackathon venue, including hacks, talks, workshops, parties, social media and other online media. Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the hackathon organisers.</p>

<p>You can find our full code of conduct at <a href="http://hackcodeofconduct.org/football-hack-day-london2015">http://hackcodeofconduct.org/football-hack-day-london2015</a></p>
      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>2. Projects</h1>
      </div>
<p>The project you submit must be your own work. You need to be the creator, and you need to ensure your project doesn't infringe the rights of any third party.</p>
<p>It's fine if your project isn't 100% new, but keep in mind that projects that haven't been updated significantly during the course of the hackathon won't score very well with the judges.</p>
<p>Don't create and/or submit projects that are illegal, profane, obscene or otherwise not very nice.</p>

      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>3. Intellectual Property</h1>
      </div>
<p>You own your project. Full stop. The event organizers and sponsors have the right to mention and link to your project in order to promote the event, its results and their participation.</p>
<p>Respect others' intellectual property. Whether that is sponsor data and assets that have been made available solely for the hackathon, or it's copyrighted images and other content.</p>

      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>4. Demos and Judging</h1>
      </div>
<p>You'll be given a set amount of time in which to demo your project for the judges. This length of time will vary depending on the number of projects submitted, but will be communicated in advance. Once the clock begins, it does not stop. The clock does not pause for equipment changes or other aspects of your demo. We have to keep to the schedule in order to keep things manageable and fair for everyone.</p>
<p>Your project will be judged on the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>Originality and Creativity</li>
<li>User Experience and Design</li>
<li>Pitch Quality</li>
<li>Overall Quality</li>
</p>

      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>5. Teams</h1>
      </div>
<p>You are allowed, and encouraged, to form teams with other developers and attendees at the Hack Day. There is no limit to the number of people on your team, but the number of people on a project may be taken into account during judging, and prizes may be hard to split among many team members. We recommend a max of 4 people. Your entire team must be on-site at the event -- no sending work to external teams or outside developers.</p>
